"""What this plugin offers, and the evidence for each entry.

Every line here is a claim about somebody else's project, so every line
was checked against that project's own repository on 2026-07-29 rather
than against a wiki, a forum post or a memory. The three that survived
are below; the ones that did not are at the bottom, with why, because a
list of what was rejected is the part a reader can actually audit.

## The rule

**Clean-room and openly licensed, or it is not here.** Nothing in this
catalogue is a dump of a retail chip. The Hub cannot check that -- a
dumped BIOS and a reimplemented one look identical on the wire -- so it
is a rule about what this file may contain, and the licence of every item
is carried in `FirmwareArtifact.license` where the operator reads it
before installing.

## Why the catalogue is static

`list()` makes no network request. Two reasons, and the second is the
real one.

Firmware is bytes an emulator *executes*. Pinning means an operator gets
the release this plugin's README says it verified, rather than whatever
was tagged this morning by someone whose CI changed. Resolving "latest"
at list time would quietly move that target, and the move would be
invisible.

And a catalogue that costs nothing is a catalogue people run. `rom-hub
firmware list open-bios` is instant and works offline.

The cost is that a new upstream release needs a new plugin release. That
is the right trade for three entries that change once a year, and
`sameboy_release` is the escape hatch for an operator who wants a newer
tag before this plugin ships one.

# -- what was left out, and why ------------------------------------------
#
# Each of these was a real candidate. Three were dropped for reasons that
# are properties of the upstream project, and one for a reason that is a
# property of this plugin. Recorded here so nobody has to establish them
# a second time, and so a future release can pick one up if the reason
# stops being true.
#
# **PCSX-ReDux OpenBIOS (PlayStation, GPL-2.0)** -- the one people most
# want, and it is not installable. `grumpycoders/pcsx-redux` has **no
# releases and no tags at all** (`GET /repos/.../releases` and `/tags`
# both answer an empty array), so there is no `openbios.bin` to fetch.
# `src/mips/openbios/README.md` documents the build as `make` under a
# Docker MIPS toolchain, and the only prebuilt copies are the ones
# `.github/workflows/linux-build.yml` installs *inside* the emulator's own
# AppImage (`make install install-openbios DESTDIR=AppDir/usr`), published
# to distrib.app rather than to GitHub. An entry pointing at a hundred
# megabytes of emulator to extract a BIOS is not an entry; an entry
# pointing at a release asset that does not exist is a 404. If the project
# ever publishes the binary, this is a one-row change.
#
# **nds-bootstrap (GPL-3.0)** -- real, maintained, and *not firmware*. Its
# release ships `nds-bootstrap.nds` and `nds-bootstrap-hb-release.nds`: a
# homebrew loader that runs on DS hardware to boot .nds files from an SD
# card. It is not a replacement for the DS BIOS (`biosnds7.bin`,
# `biosnds9.bin`) or for the DS firmware image, which is what melonDS and
# DeSmuME ask for. Installing it into a firmware directory and calling it
# DS firmware would be the exact confusion this plugin exists to prevent.
#
# **C-BIOS (MSX)** -- openly licensed and genuinely clean-room, but
# `cbios/cbios` publishes no release assets and no built `.rom` files;
# the ROMs are assembled from source. Same disqualification as OpenBIOS.
#
# **SameBoy's Super Game Boy boot ROMs** (`sgb_boot.bin`, `sgb2_boot.bin`)
# -- these are in the archive this plugin already downloads, and they are
# under the same Expat licence, so nothing about them is in doubt. They
# are absent because the Super Game Boy is a *SNES peripheral* and there
# is no unambiguous library platform for it, and the rule in
# `platforms.py` is that this plugin never guesses a platform. An item
# nobody can file is worse than an item nobody offered.
